# Response Time SLA

**Effective January 1, 2025**

> ### Why This SLA Exists
>
> Over the past year, I've noticed that I haven't been as responsive as
> I'd like to be. Life gets busy, messages pile up, and before you know
> it, weeks have passed without a reply.
>
> As a 2025 New Year's resolution, I want to change this pattern. I'm
> making a formal commitment to be more responsive, and I'm putting my
> money/food where my mouth is!

  Microsoft Teams and Reddit)

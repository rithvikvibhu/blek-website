## About Me

I'm primarily a software engineer interested in security and networks. Seeing
how so many things can be automated got me into programming in school. Since
then, I've developed websites, apps, bots and tools; managed infrastructure at
various scales; run public-goods services; and reverse engineered apps and
protocols. Along the way, I've discovered (and reported) vulnerabilities in many
systems.

I work mostly with TypeScript, Python, and Rust, and most of it is open source.

I'm also passionate about decentralized technology, including cryptocurrencies,
self-sovereign identities/domains, storage systems like IPFS/Sia, and smart
contracts.

I love working with, breaking and designing protocols – be it at the network
level or as part of architecting software.

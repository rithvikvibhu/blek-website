The [Handshake](https://handshake.org) airdrop gave 100 million HNS to open-source developers by verifying their identities through PGP/GPG keys tied to real OSS contributions. It aimed to decentralize internet naming by giving control to the engineers who helped build the internet rather than investors or the public.

To simplify the claim process, I built this GUI wrapper for the `hs-airdrop` CLI.

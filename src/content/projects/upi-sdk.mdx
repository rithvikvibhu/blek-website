This is a library that provides a common interface to perform UPI operations, backed by pluggable PSPs (Payment Service Providers).

> For the sake of simplicity, 3rd party apps are also considered PSPs.

Can be used to:

- Login to PSP accounts
- View linked bank accounts
- Check Balance
- Pay
- Collect

## Install

```sh
bun add upi.js
```

## Usage

Start with:

```ts
// Use one of the PSPs (or bring your own)
import { MockPsp } from "upi.js/psps";
const pspClient = new MockPsp();

// Use one of the stores (or bring your own)
import { JSONFileStore } from "upi.js/stores";
const store = new JSONFileStore();

// Initialize the library
const lib = new UPILib(store, pspClient);
await lib.init();

// (optional) for methods that require pin:
lib.pin = "1234"; // or a function that returns pin
```

Then call its methods:

```ts
// Get Accounts
const accounts = await lib.getAccounts();
const account = accounts[0];

// Get Balance
const balance = await lib.getBalance(account);
// returns: '12.00'

// Lookup VPA
await lib.lookupVPA("foo@hdfcbank");
// returns: {found: true, name: 'Full Name'}

// Pay
await lib.payVPA(account, "foo@hdfcbank", {
  currency: "INR",
  value: "15.00",
});

// Collect
await lib.collectVPA(account, {
  vpa: "foo@hdfcbank",
  amount: { currency: "INR", value: "15.00" },
  expiry: new Date(+new Date() + 1000 * 3600 * 1), // 1hr in future
  note: "for pizza",
});
```

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

CLI:

```bash
bun bin/run.js
```

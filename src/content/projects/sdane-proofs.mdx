[Stateless DANE](https://hsd-dev.org/HIPs/proposals/0017/) is a way to secure your website with self-signed certificates, without being blessed by anyone else. The chain of trust is rooted in DNS (with DNSSEC securing it).

S-DANE Proofs is a service that provides Urkel and DNSSEC proofs required to create Stateless DANE certificates. It's also used by resolvers like [Fingertip](https://github.com/imperviousinc/fingertip) for fallback when websites don't provide S-DANE certificates.

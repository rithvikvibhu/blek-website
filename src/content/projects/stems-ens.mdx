🌱 Stems.social was one of the first Bluesky servers.

Bluesky's identity system is based on domains and DNS.

Stems takes that concept a step further by extending the server’s resolution so that ENS domains can be natively verified and used as more sovereign and secure handles.

This is done within the existing Bluesky format of TXT-based verification by allowing users to set onchain TXT records following the [EIP-1185](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1185) standard.

With native ENS support, it's also possible to login with Handshake domains that are bridged to ENS.

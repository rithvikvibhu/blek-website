When Apple introduced Hearing Aid mode for the Airpods in 2024, the feature was
geo-restricted to a few countries, including India.

In Nov 2024, friends and I got this feature working in India by teleporting the device to the US. We reverse engineered the location services to understand how it works.

Then built a Faraday cage from aluminum extrusions and copper mesh to block GPS/Cellular/WiFi. We also spoofed the WiFi networks and GPS locations so the phone believes it's in Menlo Park, CA.

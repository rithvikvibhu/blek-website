[Vicinae](https://vicinae.com) is a launcher that is compatible with [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com) extensions. Before v0.16.2, OAuth wasn't implemented yet, which made many extensions unusable.

To get these extensions working, this polyfill filled in the gap by completing the OAuth flow in the extension's runtime. It works by spinning up a temporary web server to handle OAuth callbacks, and stores token in extension storage.

Adding it to an extension is as simple as installing the package, swapping the import, and setting your own `clientId`.

## Usage

1. Download source for any raycast extension.
2. Set the extension up for vicinae (https://docs.vicinae.com/extensions/debug-raycast)
   ```sh
   npm install
   npm install --save-dev @vicinae/api
   ```
3. Add this package
   ```sh
   npm install vicinae-ext-oauth
   ```
4. Replace
   ```ts
   import { OAuth } from "@raycast/api";
   ```
   with
   ```ts
   import { OAuth } from "vicinae-ext-oauth";
   ```
5. Set your own `clientId` (in the same file with the OAuth import)
6. Try it out!
   ```sh
   npx vici develop
   ```

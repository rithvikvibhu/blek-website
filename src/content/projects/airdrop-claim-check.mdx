The [Handshake](https://handshake.org) airdrop gave 100 million HNS to open-source developers by verifying their identities through PGP/GPG keys tied to real OSS contributions. It aimed to decentralize internet naming by giving control to the engineers who helped build the internet rather than investors or the public.

This is a tool to check if and when your (or someone's) airdrop was claimed.

Run [`hs-airdrop`](https://github.com/handshake-org/hs-airdrop) to generate your proof, and enter the index number to check.

DNS proxies usually support multiple upstreams and load balancing between them. But they don't support trying multiple upstreams in order when one returns `NXDOMAIN`. This is technically the correct behavior, but there are certain cases where it's necessary.

This is a DNS server/proxy that sequentially tries every upstream in order when one errors or even returns `NXDOMAIN`.

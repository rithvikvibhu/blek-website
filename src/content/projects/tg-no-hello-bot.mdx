A Telegram bot that discourages “Hi/Hey/Hello” messages in group chats.

It deletes greeting-only messages, warns users with a link to **https://nohello.net**, and tracks repeat offenders. If someone sends too many greetings in a row, the bot kicks them out.

Non-greeting messages reset their counter. Admins and private chats are ignored.

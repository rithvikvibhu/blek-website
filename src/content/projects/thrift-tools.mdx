Thrift Tools is a browser-based lab for decoding binary Thrift payloads.

The app auto-detects whether the bytes you paste are hex, base64, or JSON, decodes them with a custom parser, and renders the structure live in the split-pane UI.

The output pane highlights field boundaries, counts bytes, and exposes raw buffers, making it easy to diff payloads from packet captures or RPC recordings.

When you have IDL handy, you can drop it into the viewer and the tool will parse it with the built-in schema loader. Matching results against the schema unlocks field names, enums, and validation errors, and the loader persists in localStorage so your workspace survives reloads.

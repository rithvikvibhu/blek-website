The original `u/Darnit_Bot` on reddit watched many subreddits for comments containing the word "Darn", and replied "What a _darn_ shame". After reaching its goal of 500,000 darns, it gracefully [shut down](https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepFriedMemes/comments/8a9nrk/comment/dwx5i85/?context=3) on Apr 6 2018.

The next year, due to popular demand, I wrote the spiritual successor and ran `u/darnbot`, with better statistics on a website. With Reddit closing its API access to third-party apps, the bot breathed its last on May 1 2023.

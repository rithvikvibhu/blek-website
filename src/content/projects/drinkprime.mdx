[DrinkPrime](https://drinkprime.in) offers water purifiers on a rental basis that use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with the device.

After reverse engineering the BLE communication, I built a Rust SDK and CLI tool to interact with the devices over BLE.

It allows controlling the device including subscription state, and using the device without a real subscription, which is why this is not open source.

[Handshake](https://handshake.org) is a decentralized naming system for the web.

Bob Extension is a Chrome extension that brings Handshake auctions to Chrome/Chromium by exposing a `bob3` object to dApps. You can `connect`, pull balances, and run `sendBid`, `sendReveal`, `sendUpdate`, etc.

It also works as a wallet to manage Handshake coins, domains, and transactions.

I help maintain the extension by reviewing community contributions and providing support.

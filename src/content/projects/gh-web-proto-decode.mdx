When Google added authentication for the [local API](https://rithvikvibhu.github.io/GHLocalApi/) for Google Home devices, I (along with [a bunch of other folks](https://github.com/rithvikvibhu/GHLocalApi/issues/39#issuecomment-650719583)) reverse engineered the protocol and built this tool to extract the local token stored on device.

The file contains protobuf data. This website searches and extracts all device tokens from the file. Everything is processed in the browser, nothing leaves the device.
